# Introducing Data Model Datasets

(38. Module 22)
### Topics
* Understand data models
* Add event, search, and transaction datasets to data models
* Identify event object hierarchy and constraints
* Add fields based on eval expressions to transaction datasets

### Data model
A [Data Model](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.3/Knowledge/Aboutdatamodels) is a hierarchically structured search-time mapping of semantic knowledge about one or more datasets.
Key points:
* Hierarcial: parent and child relashionship.
* Dataset searching: select a specific datamodel and dataset you want to search
* Normalization tool: data mapping to a model that fits that type of data
* Large data searches: search lager amount of data faster with `tstats` and accelerated datamodels
