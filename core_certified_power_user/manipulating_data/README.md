### Use the chart, timechart, top, rare, and stats commands to transform events into data tables
`Transforming command` is a type of search command that orders the results into a data table. 

Transforming commands "transform" the specified cell values for each event into numerical values that Splunk Enterprise can use for statistical purposes. Searches that use transforming commands are called transforming searches.

Transforming commands include `chart`, `timechart`, `stats`, `top`, `rare`, `contingency`, and `highlight`.
