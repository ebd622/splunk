#### Understand types of extracted fields and when they are extracted
Field extraction methods:
* Regex: used for Unstructured data
* Delimiters: used for Structured data
* Commands: work with `rex` and `erex` in your SPL
    * `rex` - use `regex` to create a new fields our of a feild that already exists (when you a `regex` pro). This is a key-point with `rex`;
    * 'erex' - aids (helps) in generating regex for field extraction.
