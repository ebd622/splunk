#### Explain search macros
Search macro is a knowledge object that will be reused.

Search macros are reusable chunks of Search Processing Language (SPL) that you can insert into other searches. Search macros can be any part of a search, such as an eval statement or search term, and do not need to be a complete command. You can also specify whether the macro field takes any arguments.
